Automated toolkit for capturing Operaton webapp screenshots to replace Camunda screenshots in
documentation.

## Features

- **Process Deployment**: Deploy BPMN/DMN processes to Operaton
- **Data Generation**: Create users, groups, process instances, and tasks
- **Scenario Simulation**: Create specific states (tokens, history, task states)
- **Incident Creation**: Generate intentional failures for error screenshots
- **Screenshot Capture**: Automated Puppeteer-based screen capture
- **Environment Reset**: Clean wipe functionality for fresh starts
- **Makefile Interface**: Convenient commands for all operations

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
make install

# 2. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Operaton instance details

# 3. Check connection
make check

# 4. Run quick workflow (deploy + data + capture)
make quick

# Or run full workflow (includes incidents)
make full
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables (.env)

```bash
# Operaton Instance
OPERATON_BASE_URL=https://operaton-doc.open-regels.nl
OPERATON_REST_URL=https://operaton-doc.open-regels.nl/engine-rest
OPERATON_USERNAME=demo
OPERATON_PASSWORD=demo

## Simulation Scenarios

### Token Positions

Creates process instances with execution tokens at specific activities:

- Token at "Approve Invoice" user task
- Token at "Review Invoice" user task
- Token at "Prepare Bank Transfer" user task

### History Data

Generates completed process instances with various outcomes:

- Approved and paid invoices
- Rejected invoices
- Clarified and re-approved invoices

### Task States

Creates tasks in various states:

- Unassigned tasks (candidate groups)
- Assigned tasks
- Overdue tasks
- Tasks with follow-up dates

## Incident Types

### Script Task Failures

Deploys processes with JavaScript that throws errors.

### Service Task Failures

Deploys processes with non-existent delegate expressions.

### Expression Evaluation Errors

Deploys processes with gateway conditions referencing undefined variables.

### Async Job Failures

Deploys async processes that fail during job execution.

### External Task Failures

Creates external tasks and explicitly fails them with error details.

## Typical Workflow

```bash
# 1. Start fresh
make reset-force

# 2. Deploy processes
make deploy

# 3. Generate base data
make data

# 4. Create specific scenarios
make simulate

# 5. Add incidents for error screenshots
make incidents

# 6. Check what we have
make status

# 7. Capture all screenshots
make capture

# 8. Review output
ls -la output/screenshots/
```

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

```bash
make check  # Diagnose connection problems
```

### Screenshots Not Capturing

```bash
make capture-debug  # Run with visible browser
```

### Processes Not Deploying

- Check process XML validity
- Verify REST API permissions
- Check for existing deployments: `make list-deployments`

### Incidents Not Created

- Ensure processes are deployed first
- Check job executor is running
- Wait for async jobs: incidents may take a few seconds

## Adding Custom Processes

1. Add BPMN/DMN files to `processes/` directory
2. Update `config/screenshots.json` with new screenshot definitions
3. Add deployment config to deploy script if needed
4. Run `make deploy`
